# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Introduction
- AWS cognito - Authentication Service provided by AWS
- Types
  - Pools : Mainly used for storing users
  - Identities : Give users temporary access to AWS Resources

- Pools
  -  User pools: Your own authentication service where we can store users, manage theri signin, signup, recovery, mfa etc
  -  Federated pools: Thirdparty providers like Google, Facebook, Apple etc
  
 - JWT
   - JsonWebToken, used for authorization of user
   - we can store user metadata in jwt claims
   - jwt has 3 parts: Header, payload and signature. These are seperated by '.'
   - jwts can be verified with public key as well as client secret
   
   
## Hard Assignments

### Have setup cognito user pool
- Created a cognito user pool `cruddur-user-pool`
![cruddur-user-pool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116954249/224546704-7dd5b2c3-0ffe-4c22-a7a0-bbe8b06a2657.png)

### Configured React frontend with SignIn, SignUp, Forgot password
- verification code and user confirmation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116954249/224547530-ea8667cd-4a06-401f-aa5b-21fd9e46ac97.png" alt="Sampling Rule"></td>

  </tr>
</table>

- User details in frontend

## Verifying JWT in flask backend
- Used `python-jose[cryptography]` pip pacakge for jwt verification
- When user is authenticated, we get a jwt. We pass that jwt as a header called `Authorization`
- Flask backend fetches this JWT fron the request header. Then it uses for verifying users so it can show protected and unprotected endpoints
- Used variable `token_valid`. If token_valid is true, we can shouw certain page, if it isnt we can shouw another page. 
- We make token_valid to true only if jwt is verified, else in all cases like token not found, expired etc, we set it to false
- Two ways to verify jwt - using client secret or public key
- Here, I am using public key. Amazon Cognito User Pools provide a JSON Web Key (JWK) set that includes the public keys used to verify the JWTs issued by the user pool.
- Fetching the public key from Amazon Cognito User Pools using the JWKS URI does not cost anything.

### Code
- Written ` verify_jwt_token` function inside app.py file of backend
