## 2. AWS Billing alerts and Budgets
- There are two ways to get notified for AWS Bills. They are **AWS Billing alerts** which is the old way and **AWS Budgets** which is the new way.
- AWS Budgets is preferred over AWS Billing alerts because Budgets are Global and Billing alerts are regional. A Billing alert is just a cloudwatch alarm. You need to create for every AWS Region you work in.

### AWS Billing alert
- I have created 2 alarms, one for 5 dollars and one for 10 dollars as theshold

### AWS Budget
- I have been experimenting with EKS which explains the below cost. But I have AWS Credits so its fine.

#### CloudTrail
- It is an auditing service which audits all AWS events in your account
- By default, it audits only in your current region. Enable all regions while creating cloudtrail.
- 3 Types of Events : Management events, Data events, Insight events
- Management events show information about management operations performed on resources in your AWS account.
- Data events show information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource.
- Insight events identify unusual activity, errors, or user behavior in your account.
- CloudTrail has free tier for Management events: up to 5GB of CloudTrail data per month, and up to 100,000 CloudTrail events per month
- Data and insight events have additional cost
