## 2. AWS Billing alerts and Budgets
- There are two ways to get notified for AWS Bills. They are **AWS Billing alerts** which is the old way and **AWS Budgets** which is the new way.
- AWS Budgets is preferred over AWS Billing alerts because Budgets are Global and Billing alerts are regional. A Billing alert is just a cloudwatch alarm. You need to create for every AWS Region you work in.

### AWS Billing alert
- I have created 2 alarms, one for 5 dollars and one for 10 dollars as theshold

- I have been experimenting with EKS which explains the below cost. But I have AWS Credits so its fine.
