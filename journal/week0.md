# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# A. Hard Assignments

# 1. C4 Model

- I have used C4 model for understanding System Architecture of Cruddur application.
- C4 Model is a collection of 4 Core Diagrams which are Context, Container, Component and Code.

- Code Diagram is not relavent as of now. Will add it as we build on the application.

# 3. Added MFA
- Used third-party app on mobile for MFA

# 4. Created IAM User and configured access
- Created an alias for my account_id
- Created an iam user and named it *kvs-aws-bootcamp*
- Attached required policies to the user
- Created access and secret keys to the user

# 5. Cloudshell
- AWS CloudShell is a browser-based, pre-authenticated shell that you can launch directly from the AWS Management Console. 
- We can run AWS CLI commands here
- `aws sts get-caller-identity` : Gives us the current aws iam user details
- `aws account get-contact-information` : Gives contact information such as name, address, phone number etc of the user

# 6. AWS Billing alerts and Budgets (By Andrew and Chirag)
- There are two ways to get notified for AWS Bills. They are **AWS Billing alerts** which is the old way and **AWS Budgets** which is the new way.
- AWS Budgets is preferred over AWS Billing alerts because Budgets are Global and Billing alerts are regional. A Billing alert is just a cloudwatch alarm. You need to create for every AWS Region you work in.

### AWS Billing alert
- I have created 2 alarms, one for 5 dollars and one for 10 dollars as theshold

### AWS Budget
- I have been experimenting with EKS which explains the below cost. But I have AWS Credits so its fine.

### AWS Budget with AWS CLI (in gitpod)
- `gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY=""` : To store env variables permanently in gitpod workspace
- `env | grep AWS_` : To search for env variables
- `aws sts get-caller-identity`

``` 
{
    "UserId": "AIDA5BCKCG47KLMD*****",
    "Account": "895656015678",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::895656015678:user/kvs-aws-bootcamp"
} 
```
- `aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text` : gives us account_id
#### Creating Budget using CLI
- You need two files budgets.json and notifications-with-subscribers.json
- First json file contains details about the actual budget and secind file containes the subscriber. Here, the subscriber is my email address
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budgets.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

# 7. AWS Security (by Ashish Rajan)
#### AWS Organizations
- It is a Hirerarchial structure.
- This is a free resource
- Used extensively by Enterprises

#### CloudTrail
- It is an auditing service which audits all AWS events in your account
- By default, it audits only in your current region. Enable all regions while creating cloudtrail.
- 3 Types of Events : Management events, Data events, Insight events
- Management events show information about management operations performed on resources in your AWS account.
- Data events show information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource.
- Insight events identify unusual activity, errors, or user behavior in your account.
- CloudTrail has free tier for Management events: up to 5GB of CloudTrail data per month, and up to 100,000 CloudTrail events per month
- Data and insight events have additional cost
